# üö¶ Traffic Light Controller Project

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **traffic light controller** for a highway and farm road intersection using **Verilog**. The goal is to design a system that efficiently manages traffic signals at the intersection of a **highway and a farm road**, ensuring proper traffic flow and safety.

The system consists of **four traffic signals**:
- **Highway Signal 1**
- **Highway Signal 2**
- **Farm Road Signal 1**
- **Farm Road Signal 2**

### üîß Design Approach
- **Finite State Machine (FSM):** The core logic is built using a **state machine** with **18 different states**, each defining specific traffic light behaviors based on a set delay system.
- **Timing & Synchronization:** The system uses **predefined delay values** to regulate transitions between states.
- **ROM-Based Verification:** The design incorporates a **ROM module** to store the expected values for all traffic light states, which are then compared with the actual output to ensure accuracy.
- **Design Validation:** A final verification step is performed using a **testbench**, ensuring that the traffic light transitions work as intended and detecting mismatches between the expected and actual values.

## üéØ Features
1- **State Machine-Based Control:**
   - Implements a **finite state machine (FSM)** to manage traffic lights.
   - Supports **18 different states** based on a predefined delay system.

2- **Traffic Light Encoding:**
   - üü¢ **Green:** `00`
   - üü° **Yellow (when changing from green):** `01`
   - üî¥ **Red:** `10`
   - üü† **Red-Yellow (when changing from red):** `11`

3- **Design Verification with ROM:**
   - Stores expected traffic light states in **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**.
   - Compares real-time outputs against expected values.
   - Reports mismatches using a built-in **analyzer module**.

4- **Testbenches for Validation:**
   - **State Machine Testbench:** Ensures logical behavior.
   - **ROM Testbench:** Verifies stored expected values.
   - **Final System Testbench:** Integrates all components and validates performance.

## üîÑ Traffic Light States
The system operates with **18 different states**, each defining a unique traffic signal configuration. The states regulate the flow of vehicles between the **highway** and **farm road** by alternating between green, yellow, and red signals. Below are some key states:

- **S0 (Initial State):** All lights are **red** to ensure a controlled start.
- **S1-S2:** The highway traffic light transitions to **green**, allowing vehicles to pass while farm road lights remain **red**.
- **S3-S5:** The highway light transitions to **yellow** and then **red**, preparing to allow farm road traffic.
- **S6-S8:** The farm road light turns **green**, allowing farm vehicles to move while the highway is stopped.
- **S9-S17:** Alternates between different yellow, red, and red-yellow states, ensuring smooth transitions between the two roads.
- **S17 ‚Üí S0:** Resets the cycle, returning to an all-red state before starting again.

The system ensures fairness by assigning proper timing delays for each state, optimizing traffic flow and preventing congestion.

## üèó Design Philosophy
This design follows a **modular approach** to ensure clarity and efficiency:
1. **State Machine Module:**
   - Implements an **FSM** to handle traffic light transitions.
   - Uses **predefined parameters** for each state and corresponding traffic light behavior.
   - Maintains a **5-bit counter** to control timing for each state.

2. **ROM-Based Verification:**
   - Stores expected traffic light outputs to validate FSM performance.
   - Compares **real-time traffic signals** with stored ROM values to detect errors.

3. **Hierarchical Module Structure:**
   - **State Machine:** Controls traffic light transitions.
   - **ROM Generator:** Stores correct outputs for verification.
   - **Testbenches:** Simulate and validate behavior before implementation.

This structured approach ensures **correct traffic flow**, **proper timing control**, and **reliable verification mechanisms** for the system.
